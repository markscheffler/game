//  AssetDragDrop.h - what happens when you drag a file out of the Assets panel
//  and drop it on something.
//
//  ImGui matches a drag SOURCE to a drop TARGET using a short text id, and a
//  typo in that text does not fail loudly - the drop is simply never accepted
//  and nothing on screen explains why. That is a bad half-hour, and it is
//  entirely avoidable by having exactly one definition of each id that both
//  ends use. Hence this file.
//
//  ==========================================================================
//  WHAT A DROP MEANS depends on where it lands:
//
//    image  -> Scene view      create a new entity there with that sprite
//    image  -> Hierarchy row   give THAT entity the sprite (adding the
//                              component if it does not have one)
//    image  -> Inspector       the same, for whatever is selected
//    script -> Hierarchy row   attach a ScriptComponent bound to that script
//    script -> Inspector       the same, for whatever is selected
//    scene  -> Scene view      load it
//
//  The two "apply it to this entity" cases are identical in effect and would
//  be very easy to write twice with a subtle difference between them, so
//  ApplyAssetToEntity is one implementation both use.
