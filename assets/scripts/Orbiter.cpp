//  Orbiter - a worked example script, and the file to read before writing your
//  own.
//
//  It moves its entity around its own starting position in a circle.
//
//  That is deliberately something SpinComponent cannot do. Spin turns a
//  transform on the spot, and turning a PARENT sweeps its children round with
//  it - but nothing built into the engine moves a lone entity along a path.
//  Behaviour that is specific to one game, and has no business being a
//  built-in component, is exactly what a script is for.
//
//  Attach it by dragging Orbiter.cpp from the Assets panel onto an entity in
//  the Hierarchy or the Inspector.
