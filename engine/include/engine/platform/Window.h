//  WEEK 1 TEMPLATE - you implement this.
//
//  This header exists to give you the Ch. 2.2 exercise in a form you will
//  actually keep: a class DECLARED here and DEFINED in Window.cpp. Read the
//  declaration/definition distinction in the chapter, then notice that this
//  file promises things it does not contain. The linker is what checks that
//  promise, and it checks it much later than the compiler does.
//
//  Deliberately holding raw SDL pointers is wrong, and we will fix it.
//  Leave it wrong for now as the conversion is more instructive
//  when you have working code to convert.
