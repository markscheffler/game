//  ScriptLibrary.cpp - loading and unloading a project's compiled scripts.
//  See ScriptLibrary.h for the order a reload has to happen in.
//
//  SDL is used to do the loading. SDL_LoadObject and SDL_UnloadObject are a
//  thin cross-platform wrapper over LoadLibrary on Windows and dlopen
//  everywhere else, so this file needs no #ifdef per operating system. SDL is
//  already a dependency, which makes it a much better choice here than writing
//  the platform code by hand.
